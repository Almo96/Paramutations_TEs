## Introduction

With this simulation we wanted to compare the trap model scenario
outcome with one where paramutations are taken into account and see
which of the two gives better expectations on real data.

### Initial conditions:

A population of 1000, 5 chromosomes of size 10 Mb, a recombination rate
of 4cM, 300Kb piRNA clusters and an initial number of TEs equal to 100.

We used 1000 replicates for each simulation.
